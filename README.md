My "Morse Code" translator project that I made for an Engenuics, MPG2 board.
The way this translator works, is you use the "Button 0" on the MPG2 Board for your dot/dash entry, and you use the "Button 1" for spaces.
After you enter a character, wait about a second for the letter to be pushed to the screen. Congratulations! You can now enter characters!
I hope to use the capacitive touch sliders as a delete button, but that feature will be Coming Soon!
